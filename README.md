====================
You're given two inputs: a positive integer x and an array A of
positive integers. Your task is to find the subset(s) of A whose sum
is closest but not bigger than x. The order of the output does not
matter, but you should return all possible solutions.

For example:
x = 29
A = [2, 8, 3, 9, 11]

output = [8, 9, 11]

The sum is 28, which is the closest you can get to x.

Bonus: accept all integers, not just positive ones.
